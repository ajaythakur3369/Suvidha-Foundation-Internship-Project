Suvidha Foundation Internship Project

The purpose of this project is to produce a model for Abstractive Text Summarization, starting with the RNN encoder-decoder as the baseline model. From there, we come across the effectiveness of different methods for attention in abstractive summarization. These methods try to first understand the text and then rephrase it in a shorter manner, using possibly different words. For perfect abstractive summary, the model has to first truly understand the document and then try to express that understanding in short possibly using new words and phrases. We have used the concept of an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network with LSTM units and attention to generate summary from a given text.
