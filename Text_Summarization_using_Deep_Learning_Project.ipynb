              "[{'story': \"BOSTON , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A huge mural greets visitors to the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston . It 's a memorial to the building 's namesake , who died unexpectedly in 1993 .\\n\\nHundreds of tiles are used to create the `` magic '' mural at the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston .\\n\\nA young Reggie Lewis , wearing his No. 35 Boston Celtics jersey , dominates the middle of the 11-foot-by-14-foot artwork . At the bottom left is a picture of him and his wife . To his right , the face of legendary Celtic Larry Bird .\\n\\nBut as young men in sweats and sneakers make their way into the gym , something strange happens . The mural comes alive . The photo of a beaming Lewis in formal attire transforms into Lewis the basketball player , streaking down the court .\\n\\nLarry Bird 's picture morphs into that of another famous player , Robert Parrish .\\n\\nWith each step , the mural transforms , representing the many scenes in one man 's life .\\n\\nArtist Rufus B. Seder calls these `` movies for a wall '' Lifetiles . The Massachusetts artist invented the Lifetiles medium and is the only artist in the world using it . He has more than 30 Lifetiles installations around the globe . Watch a magic mural in action ''\\n\\nAt the Taiwan Aquarium , dolphins swim on the wall alongside awestruck children . Bucking broncos line the halls of the the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth , Texas . Dancers spin and twirl along with passengers on luxury cruise ships in the south of France . And Seder calls the the South San Francisco , California , BART station his `` own personal gallery , '' with more than 16 installations .\\n\\nLifetiles do n't use electricity , moving parts or tricky lighting -- just an elaborate and painstaking process done out of Seder 's Eye Think Inc. studio near Boston .\\n\\n`` What I 'm after is trying to create an experience which totally takes you by surprise , '' he said .\\n\\nScanimation on the shelf\\n\\nIf the technology you see in Lifetiles looks familiar , you might have caught something similar at a local bookstore . The popular children 's books `` Gallop ! '' and `` Swing ! '' were also written and illustrated by Seder . With a technique he calls scanimation , pictures in the books come alive as you flip the page .\\n\\nIt 's a kids ' favorite that quite a few parents enjoy , too , based on sales numbers . `` Swing ! '' and `` Gallop ! '' are currently on The New York Times bestseller list .\\n\\nSeder originally used scanimation in greeting cards he sold at trade shows around the country . Then Workman Publishing came calling , asking Seder to develop a book based on the eye-catching technique .\\n\\nThat 's when Seder caught lightning in a bottle . After several decades as a somewhat unknown artist , he found himself flying to China to teach the scanimation technique to book makers . Just a few years later , there are over 2 million copies of `` Gallop ! '' in print in more than 13 languages .\\n\\nStill awed by their popularity , Seder said , `` I would 've been satisfied if a limited edition sold well . It totally blew my mind what happened . ''\\n\\nAlthough his books ' success have gained Seder some newfound publicity , the Lifetiles are truly his life 's work .\\n\\nThe relatively unknown and seemingly modern form of art is n't new at all . Seder 's been working on Lifetiles for more than 20 years , inspired by toys from the 1850s called zoetropes and an active imagination as a youngster .\\n\\n`` I started making movies when I was 12 years old , '' he said , `` so I was always into motion pictures and especially into optical tricks and techniques that trick the eye . ''\\n\\nHow does it work ?\\n\\nAs a viewer , you do n't have to learn how to see a Lifetile . It 's intuitive , and one immediately understands the concept . As you walk past the mural , it begins to move along with you .\\n\\nBut the question that immediately comes to mind -- and the one Seder gets the most -- is , `` How does it work ? ''\\n\\n`` The short answer is , it 's magic , '' Seder said . `` The longer answer is , it 's like a flipbook . I 've taken all the pages from a flipbook and scrambled them all together , and I 've put them up on the wall and made them animate . ''\\n\\nThe lengthy process also requires attention to detail . Much like an animator , he creates a series of drawings on his computer . He then strips down each image into what becomes an indistinguishable picture made up of a series of vertical lines .\\n\\nThis squiggly-lined image becomes the equivalent of a photo negative . The negative gets sandblasted onto a hand-cast glass tile made in Seder 's studio . The heavy , 8-inch-square glass tiles get painted , scraped , fired in a kiln and finally added piece by piece to a Lifetiles mural . Hundreds of these tiles work in harmony to create a huge moving image when displayed on a wall .\\n\\nSeder patented the painstaking technique but thinks most other artists would n't have his patience , even if they had his know-how .\\n\\n`` It 's not that I 've been playing my cards close to my vest , '' he said . `` It 's just very difficult to do . ''\\n\\nA Lifetiles installation , from conception to completion , can take up to a year to complete . It 's a labor of love he shares with others who walk by his `` magic '' walls .\\n\\n`` I love to watch people react to the work . They do n't expect a wall to move , '' he said . `` They 'll be walking down the hallway in a museum and walking outdoors through a zoo ... and suddenly they realize , ` Those dolphins are starting to move next to me ! How is that possible ? ' ''\\n\\n\",\n",

Blige pulled off an Oprah-worthy seminar on affirmation with `` Just Fine '' to close out the three-day fest , which celebrates black music and African-American culture .\\n\\nThe synth-heavy number pierced to the core of the capacity Louisiana Superdome crowd . As Blige danced around in a shimmering black mini-dress , the audience took over the number and launched into a sing-along that reached up to the fifth level of the arena .\\n\\nEarlier , Blige told Rolling Stone , `` I do n't think fans come here to hear you talk about your new album . They come to hold their stomachs when you sing that song that you love so much . That 's what -LSB- the festival -RSB- is about . To get that nostalgia . You got ta give the people what they want .

''\\n\\nRiffing off recent performances , West 's show was a mix of his Coachella set -LRB- in three acts -RRB- and his VMA performance -LRB- red suit -RRB- but with a nod to the Essence crowd , as he finished with a stirring musical testimony to his mother , `` Hey Mama . ''\\n\\nPhotos : The Hottest Live Performances from Coachella 2011\\n\\n`` It feels so good to be back home , '' ` Ye told the audience -- not unlike Blige , preaching the power of healing . `` When I say home , I mean my people . I travel the world . I been around the world . I got into a little trouble . A little controversy here and there . But before I go any further in the show , I wan na thank you for coming out and still supporting me . ''\\n\\nFriday night headliner Usher and Charlie Wilson -LRB- Friday 's penultimate performer -RRB- had an unofficial generational game of one-upmanship . Wilson commandeered the stage for what felt like an eternity , though in actuality it was much closer to two hours , still , surely more than his allotment . The former Gap Band singer ran through a series of his old cohort 's hits , from `` Outstanding '' to `` You Dropped a Bomb on Me . ''\\n\\nUncle Charlie , as he 's been dubbed by Snoop Dogg , cut into Usher 's constituency when he launched into `` There Goes My Baby . '' The song not only shares the title with one of Usher 's tracks , but the swooping song is best known -LRB- at least to the younger set -RRB- as Wilson 's dedication to Snoop and his wife when the couple renewed their vows . Wilson smiled , preened and pranced as the audience swayed from side to side .\\n\\nA rejuvenated Usher , however , proved it 's still a younger man 's game . He also arrived from the sky like West , but once he landed -LRB- equipped with a helmet -RRB- , the pre-July 4th fireworks started . `` U Do n't Have to Call '' and `` You Make Me Wan na '' thundered throughout the dome . Shrieks echoed as leather-clad Ush slithered between dancers during `` Lil Freak '' and `` Trading Places . ''\\n\\nBut , much like Blige noted , the crowd wanted nostalgia and Usher offered it in heaps with a three-song Michael Jackson medley . It was a true `` OMG '' moment .\\n\\nCopyright © 2011 Rolling Stone .\\n\\n\",\n",

            "I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.\n",

            "i know the product title says molecular gastronomy  but do not let that scare you off  i have been looking for this for a while now  not for food science  but for something more down to earth  i use it to make my own coffee creamer   i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet   but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat  and honestly  i hate to use manufactured  food  items  i really do not think they are good for the body  on the other hand  i hate using cold milk or cream  because i like hot coffee   i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer  i also bought low fat  non instant  milk powder and regular milk powder  the non instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low fat milk  but does not dissolve good in cold water   which is not a problem for hot coffee  you will have to play with the ratios   i would not do just the heavy cream  it made the coffee too rich  also  i think the powder is too expensive to just use on it is own  i like mixing 1 3 of each together   for flavoring  i bough cocoa bean powder  vanilla bean powder  and caster  superfine  sugar  i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers  if you wanted  you could use a fake sweetner powder instead  i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars  i also use my little food chopper food processor to blend everything  so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom  let it settle for a bit before opening the top though   this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors  i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolate orange mix   all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online  take the time to experiment  maybe you do not use any low fat milk  or do not add any flavorings  it is up to you  also  would make great housewarming host ess  gifts   i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it  and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking   but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great \n",
